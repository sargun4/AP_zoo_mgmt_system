## Additional Assumptions:

1. In manageAnimals in my Admin class ,I have added 2 kinds of animals for each type of animals - Mammals, Amphibians, and Reptiles.

- Those animals are- 
Mammals
// Elephant
// Monkey
Amphibians
// Frog
// Salamander
Reptiles
// Snake
// Turtle
for which i hv used the method- 
     private static void addSpecificAnimals(List<Animal> animals){...}
  
 
2. for my discount class, i hv additoinal features-
     private int id; -unique id
     private String description; -description of the discount.
     private String code; -code that visitors can use to apply the discount

3. In my atrraction class, i hv 'purchasedTicketList' which will give info about the no. of purchased tickets by the members buying their tickets.

4. My ticket class checks for no. of visits allowed and the no of visits remaining for a particular member  visitng a particular attraction based on the no of tickets the member has.
